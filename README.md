### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Javascript is a object oriented language that gives an action to an element.  The JavaScript can be place within the html document within the <script></script> tags, in the <head> or in the <body>.  Also the JavaScript can be placed in an external document and be called when necessary by linking it in the html document with <script src=”filename.js”></script>.  The external JavaScript provides advantages like making easier to maintain and increase the speed of html loading. There are several data types: the primitive (number, Boolean and string); complex (object, array); and special ( null, undefined).   Variables are used to store data in the memory and there are several rules to name it.  

2. Another lesson learn were the different JavaScript output (or display options) that provides options of outputting data. Methods are:  document.write used to print the value; window.alert  or alert() in which  the data will output in a message popup; console.log, which is used to write in the web browser console, use most for debugging and testing purposes; prompt() used to request information in a popup window.

3. Some of the best practices for JavaScript are choosing short names for variables, avoid global variables and they will be used we should use closures or one global object to encapsulate them, use “var” for all your variables, indent the code to make it readable, use curly braces to define codes of block, comment the codes, always use semi-colons, be aware of the use of automatic semi-colon, declare variables outside loops and reduce DOM operations.
